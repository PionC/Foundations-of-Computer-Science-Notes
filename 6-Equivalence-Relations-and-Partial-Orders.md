## **Equivalence Relations**
Equivalence relations capture a general notion of "equality".  
* **How to prove a Relation is a Equivalence Relation?**  
<u>A binary relation $R\subseteq S\times S$ is equivalence relation if it satisfies (R), (S), (T).</u>
  * **Reflexive (R):** Every object should <u>be "equal" to itself</u>.  
  $x=x$
  * **Symmetric (S):** if $x$ is "equal" to $y$, then $y$ should be "equal" to $x$.  
  $x=y \Rightarrow y=x$
  * **Transitive (T):** if $x$ is "equal" to $y$ and  $y$ is "equal" to $z$, then $x$ should be "equal" to $z$.  
  $x=y,\ y=z, \Rightarrow x=z$
